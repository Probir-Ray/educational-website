                <p>Learning a new language involves listening, speaking, reading, writing, sometimes even a new alphabet and writing format.</p>
                <p>Instead, what you need is a balanced study plan: a mix of study activities that target both spoken and written language, and gives attention to all three key principles.</p>
                <p>Take courses from best instructors and universities. Courses include recorded auto-graded assignments, video lectures, and community discussion forums. When you complete a course, youâ€™ll be eligible to receive a shareable electronic Course Certificate for a small fee.</p>
